## Examples for Different Niches

```python
# CA Firms in Delhi
NICHE = "ca_firms_delhi"
SEARCH_QUERIES = [
    "CA firm in Connaught Place",
    "chartered accountant in Lajpat Nagar",
    "CA office in Dwarka",
]

# Gyms in Bangalore
NICHE = "gyms_bangalore"
SEARCH_QUERIES = [
    "gym in Koramangala",
    "fitness center in Indiranagar",
    "gym in Whitefield",
]

# Restaurants in Hyderabad
NICHE = "restaurants_hyderabad"
SEARCH_QUERIES = [
    "restaurant in Jubilee Hills",
    "restaurant in Banjara Hills",
    "restaurant in Hitech City",
]
```

## Tips

- **Getting blocked?** Set `HEADLESS = False` and increase `DELAY_BETWEEN_LISTINGS = 3000`
- **More leads?** Add more area-wise queries. Each query = ~120 leads.
- **Duplicates?** The scraper deduplicates automatically before saving.
- **No website?** The `Website Status` column will show "Not Listed" — these are your warm leads to pitch web dev services to.
